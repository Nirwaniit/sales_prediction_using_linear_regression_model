## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the relationship between advertising investments in TV, radio, and newspaper and their effect on sales. By applying linear regression, we aim to develop a reliable model capable of predicting sales based on advertising expenditures in these mediums.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical data on advertising expenditures and corresponding sales figures. It includes the following variables:
- TV: Advertising budget on TV
- Radio: Advertising budget on radio
- Newspaper: Advertising budget on newspaper
- Sales: Corresponding sales figures

The dataset provides the necessary information to train and evaluate the linear regression model accurately.

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the trained linear regression model for sales prediction, follow these steps:

1. Load the saved model.
2. Prepare input data with advertising expenditures in TV, radio, and newspaper.
3. Use the model to predict sales based on the input data.

Refer to the documentation or code comments for a demonstration of how to use the trained model for sales prediction.

## Results

The final model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 91% in predicting sales based on advertising expenditures. This indicates the strong correlation between advertising investments in TV, radio, and newspaper and their impact on sales.
